# OMOP Tools List üè•

> A curated list of open source OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) tools and resources.

## What is OMOP?

The OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) is a standardized data model for observational healthcare data. It enables large-scale analytics across different healthcare systems and data sources. This list focuses on open source tools that work with OMOP CDM.
